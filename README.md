.emacs.d
========

To install:
1. Backup existing .emacs/_emacs/init.el and .emacs.d 
2. Run:
  $ cd && git clone http://github.com/sebastiw/.emacs.d.git
3. Start emacs

The first time emacs is started, it will automatically install
required packages from elpa/melpa/marmalade, this process will take
some time. Don't worry, next time emacs will be much faster.
